# About unitcell


unitcell is a utility package to work and operate on periodic lattices and
crystal structures. It was developed in 2008 by Angel Yanguas-Gil as a helper
tool for his research, and it is not intended to be a full-fledged crystallographic
package. For instance, it does not support CIF files. Its main purpose is to 
iterate through sites in a crystal, for instance to get lists of coordinates.

unitcell is licensed through the BSD licence.
